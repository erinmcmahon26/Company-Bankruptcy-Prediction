# Company Bankruptcy Prediction

Assess company bankruptcy based on the Taiwan Stock exchange from years 1999 to 2009 (source: Taiwan Economic Journal via Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction/code). The goal is to predict bankruptcy using a set of models and comparing which model has the highest performance:   

  1. SVM
  2. Logistic regression model
  4. Na√Øve Bayes model
  5. LDA
  6. QDA
  7. KNN
  8. Decision Trees
  9. Random Forests

The dataset was highly imbalanced and different sampling techniques were used to balance the data for better model predictions. Models were evaluated and compared to see which performed the best.
