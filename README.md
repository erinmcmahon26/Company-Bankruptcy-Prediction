Split the training set into an 80% training and 20% validation set. 
Build three models: an 
  1. SVM
  2. Logistic regression model
  3. Na√Øve Bayes model
Conduct hyperparameter tuning for the SVM kernel. Evaluate goodness of fit metrics including TPR, FPR, precision, recall, and accuracy on the training and validation sets. Build ROC and Precision / Recall graphs. Evaluate your models' performance on the validation set using the F1-score.
